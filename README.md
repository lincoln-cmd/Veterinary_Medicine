# 🐾 Veterinary AI Research & Development Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents the study and development of **Veterinary AI projects**,  
covering disease diagnosis, behavior monitoring, clinical support, and One Health systems.  

- **Goal**: Apply AI to veterinary medicine and animal health.  
- **Scope**: Diagnostic AI, welfare monitoring, clinical/medication AI, livestock & public health.  
- **Method**: Step-by-step learning → small projects → practical applications.
